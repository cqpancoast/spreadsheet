# What we were able to do

Based on the README provided with the code and by looking at their view interface methods, 
we were able to make every feature promised by their view implementation work with our model
and controller implementations. These features include: cell selection, infinite scrolling,
automatic updating of model contents (by use of a button in their view), and cell content 
editing, including cell deletion.

We are thankful for this, because it means this README doesn't have to be very long.
