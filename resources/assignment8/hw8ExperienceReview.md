# A Review of the Whole Homework 8 Shebang

Honestly, super fun. I'd been told for, like, a year that this would be the most difficult coding thing I'd ever have to do, so I was rather anxious going into it. While the code we received was by no means perfect, we were lucky in that there was minimal coupling between the different interfaces. 

If we had to do everything all over again, we wouldn't have made everything a String.

If there's anything we learned from receiving code that other people had written and then being expected to work from it, it was that clear documentation is critically important. We'd always been pretty good (we think) about clear documentation of our methods and classes and interfaces and whatever, but the only reason that we understood the code we were provided was because we already had a pretty good idea about how it should work and how it should be made anyway. When working in ___tHe ReAl WoRlD___ there will be no such guarantees.

We did not have to make any updates for our customers, and in our limited interactions with them they were very polite.

Our experience with our providers was great, all around â€“ they responded quickly to the problems we had regarding too many details of their model implementation being exposed via their interface.

Thanks for a great year! I (Casey) hope to see you in Software Dev, which I'll be taking in the Fall. Angela is Spring, and she is very sad.

Peace out.
